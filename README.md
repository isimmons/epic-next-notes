# Epic Next Notes

Taking the Epic Web Foundations Workshop, I decided to build my own Remix app from scratch and use it to work along with the workshop.

I plan on trying to build the same application with Next, Nuxt, and Laravel.

This is the Next version.

It's up to the end of the routing lessons and everything is basically working.
